### Overview of the analysis:
 
The purpose of this analysis was to update the client's UFO Sightings webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added.

- First, a table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array.
- Next, filters were created to make the table fully dynamic, so that it will react to user input.
- Finally, the table was placed into an HTML file for easy viewing.

### Results:
Visitors to the UFO Sightings webpage are now able to perform searches using the fields provided to filter for information on UFO sightings by multiple criteria or single criteria ass seen in the example images below.

### Summary:
The new webpage design is very appealing aesthetically. A few more tweaks could make it even more user friendly and interactive. One drawback of this new design is that the filters are case sensitive and all entries must be typed in lower case and spelling must be correct.
Recommendations for further development are to have the search fields clear previous entries for a cleaner less confusing interface. Also, enabling the search results to be sorted by date, ascending or descending would be useful.
